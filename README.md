1. Prepare Your Repository

* Ensure your repository contains all website files (index.html, style.css, images, etc.).



* Name your repository as: username.github.io



2\. Enable GitHub Pages



* Navigate to your repository on GitHub.



* Click Settings → Pages



* Under Source: Select the main branch
* Folder: / (root)



* Click Save.



GitHub will display your site’s URL: https://username.github.io/



3\. Update and Maintain Your Site

* Make updates locally or directly on GitHub.



GitHub Pages automatically reflects the latest updates.

My key takeaways from this exercise is the realization of the amount of time it takes to create professional portfolio. Even though I have worked with HTML and CSS before, it still took a lot of time to create despite it being simple.
